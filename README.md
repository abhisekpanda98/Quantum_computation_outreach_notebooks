# Quantum Computation Outreach Notebooks 

## 🔎 What is this repo about  
This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks designed for **outreach and educational purposes** to help newcomers grasp the fundamentals of quantum computation.  
Each notebook corresponds to a “day” or a session — starting from first principles and gradually building up intuition about quantum bits, quantum circuits, and computation — making quantum computing more accessible.

## What’s inside  
| File / Folder | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `17_Nov_Day_1.ipynb` | First session — introductory concepts (classical vs quantum, qubits, basic theory) |
| `18_Nov_Day_2.ipynb` | Second session — quantum states / superposition / basic quantum operations |
| `19_Nov_Day_3.ipynb` | Third session — quantum gates and simple circuits |
| `20_Nov_Day_4.ipynb` | Fourth session — measurement, collapse, basic quantum algorithms / ideas |
| `21_Nov_Day_5.ipynb` | Fifth session — entanglement, multi-qubit systems, more complex circuits |
| `24_Nov_Day_6.ipynb` | Sixth session — example quantum algorithms / demonstrations |
| `25_Nov_Day_7.ipynb` | Seventh session — deeper topics, more example circuits or advanced ideas |
| `26_Nov_Day_8.ipynb` | Eighth session — wrap-up, summary, further reading / resources |
| `img/` | Supporting images / diagrams used in the notebooks (where applicable) |

## Why this repo matters & Who it’s for  
- **Students and beginners** with little or no background in quantum computing.  
- People curious about **quantum vs classical computing**, and how qubits and quantum gates differ from classical bits and logic gates.  
- Educators, study-group organizers, or workshop facilitators looking for ready-to-use teaching material.  
- Anyone who wants a **hands-on, notebook-based approach** (code + explanations) to learn quantum computation intuitively.

## How to get started  

1. Clone the repository:
